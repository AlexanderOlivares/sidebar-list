### A list-taking app

Create your own private list or invite a friend to a "sidebar list". Just as judges and lawyers have a sidebar for private conversations, you and your invited editor will have a private list.
Only you and your editor will be authorized to create, edit and delete items from your shared-list.

### Why?

I made this project so that my girlfriend and I could add items to our grocery list independently. This app also works great for a list of "things to pack" for a vacation.

### How to use

Simply register and add items to your list. Click "invite editor" to send an invitation-email to a friend. Once your editor accepts your invitation you will both be able to add items to your list as well as edit each other's items.
